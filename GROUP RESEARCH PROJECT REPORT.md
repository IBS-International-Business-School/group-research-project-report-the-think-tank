## Executive Summary
This project was conducted by the Data Analytics team at FlexForce Consulting to examine how remote, hybrid, and office-based work models influence employee productivity, communication, and well-being. The goal was to provide insights that support evidence-based workforce planning and hybrid work optimization for global organizations.

The study focused on four core factors influencing workplace outcomes: **time management, task completion, collaboration quality, and job satisfaction**. A structured questionnaire was designed to collect employee perceptions across these dimensions, along with demographic and work-context information.

The research followed a four-week schedule:
- **Week 1:** Literature review and survey design  
- **Week 2:** Pilot testing and data collection  
- **Week 3:** Data cleaning and preliminary analysis  
- **Week 4:** Final analysis, interpretation, and reporting
